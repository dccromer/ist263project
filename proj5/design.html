      <h2>Where Architecture Meets Data</h2>
      <p>Smart buildings rely on data, but effective design enables that data to have a meaningful influence. When architects evaluate materials, layout, orientation, and mechanical systems, they are determining how effectively a structure can adapt to real-world situations. This page examines how architecture and analytics work together to create smarter, more energy-efficient environments.</p>

      <h3>Materials Matter</h3>
      <p>Choosing the correct building materials influences how efficiently a space maintains heat, absorbs light, and lowers noise. For example, employing thermally efficient insulation lessens the demand on HVAC systems. When sensor data reveals how heat travels through a structure over time, architects may rethink the location of walls or windows to improve efficiency.</p>

      <h3>Layout and Ventilation</h3>
      <p>Open floor patterns make it easy for occupancy and air quality sensors to collect accurate data and regulate ventilation accordingly. A faulty arrangement might result in "dead zones" where sensors are ineffective, causing discomfort and wasting energy. Architects who collaborate with engineers from the start can prevent these challenges.</p>

      <h3>Orientation and Natural Lighting</h3>
      <p>A building's orientation determines how much natural sunlight it receives, which in turn influences both its heating and lighting requirements. When combined with real-time light sensors, intelligent systems can reduce artificial lighting when it is no longer needed, thereby conserving energy. Design factors, such as window location, have a direct impact on the effectiveness of sensors and energy dashboards.</p>

      <h3>My SOURCE Research: Real-World Learning</h3>
      <p>As part of my SOURCE research project at Syracuse, I have been analyzing building sensor data to uncover inefficiencies in campus buildings. I analyze temperature, humidity, and CO₂ levels at various times of day and in different zones.</p>
      <p>When a classroom consistently has higher CO₂ levels, it may be due to a layout issue that prevents adequate airflow. I've also discovered how predictive maintenance alerts may assist in identifying underperforming equipment due to improper location or old infrastructure.</p>
      <p>This experience has shown me the importance of incorporating data-driven thinking into design from the outset. It is not enough to install sensors afterward; the most intelligent buildings are those planned with systems in mind from the start.</p>

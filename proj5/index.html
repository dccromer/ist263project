      <h2>Welcome to the Future of Smart Buildings</h2>
      <p>Buildings today are more than just walls and windows—they're becoming innovative systems that respond to the people inside them. With the help of data analytics and sensors, smart buildings can adjust lighting, temperature, ventilation, and other parameters in real-time.</p>
      <p>One of the key tools making this possible is predictive maintenance. Instead of waiting for systems to break down, smart buildings utilize data to identify early warning signs and address problems before they occur. This reduces costs, prevents downtime, and improves energy efficiency.</p>
      <p>Smart buildings rely on interconnected systems, such as HVAC, lighting, and occupancy sensors. These systems send data to a central platform, which analyzes current conditions and automatically adjusts settings such as temperature or airflow. For example, if a room becomes too crowded and CO₂ levels rise, the system can increase ventilation immediately.</p>

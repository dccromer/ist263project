      <h2>Smart Buildings in Action</h2>
      <p>Smart buildings are more than a concept of the future; they are now being utilized worldwide to reduce energy consumption, enhance indoor comfort, and streamline maintenance. These buildings use sensors and automated technologies to collect data and make real-time choices. The following two examples show how this technology works in real-world scenarios.</p>

    <section>
      <h3>The Edge Building – Amsterdam, Netherlands</h3>
      <p>The Edge is widely regarded as one of the world's most innovative and sustainable office towers. It features over 28,000 sensors that monitor various aspects, including motion, light levels, temperature, and humidity. These sensors gather data in real time and input it into a central control system, which automatically adjusts lighting, heating, and ventilation based on occupancy and the time of day.</p>
      <p>Predictive maintenance is one of the most significant characteristics. The system may identify early symptoms of mechanical problems, such as rising motor temperatures or unusual energy consumption patterns, and inform personnel before the equipment breaks. This helps the facility operate more efficiently and decrease downtime.</p>
      <p>Employees may also use a linked app to reserve desks or rooms that meet their specific needs, such as those with preferred lighting or temperature settings.</p>

      <h3>Syracuse Center of Excellence – Syracuse, NY</h3>
      <p>The Syracuse Center of Excellence is an advanced research center located on the Syracuse University campus. It acts as both a functioning structure and a living laboratory. Inside, sensors monitor air quality, temperature, humidity, energy use, and occupancy patterns throughout the structure.</p>
      <p>This information is used to control systems in real time and to support research into indoor environmental quality and sustainability. When sensors detect high CO₂ levels in a classroom, the ventilation system may automatically boost airflow to provide a healthy atmosphere.</p>
      <p>The CoE also uses predictive analytics to detect inefficiencies early on, such as recognizing HVAC components that are wearing out or lighting that isn't working correctly, so they can be repaired before performance suffers.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>Both examples demonstrate how buildings can utilize sensor data to reduce environmental impact while also enhancing the day-to-day lives of those who use them. Smart technologies are transforming how buildings operate and what we expect from the spaces around us, through energy savings and improved air quality.</p>
